    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing**: Extracted structured information from resumes and job descriptions\n",
    "2. **Embedding**: Generated semantic vector representations using SentenceTransformers\n",
    "3. **Matching**: Computed cosine similarity to find best matches\n",
    "4. **Analysis**: Analyzed skill gaps and coverage\n",
    "5. **Explanation**: Generated AI-powered match explanations (when LLM available)\n",
    "6. **Visualization**: Created heatmaps and charts to visualize results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "- **John Smith** (Data Scientist) is an excellent match for the ML Engineer role\n",
    "- **Sarah Johnson** (Software Engineer) matches well with the Full Stack Developer position\n",
    "- **Michael Chen** (Marketing Analyst) is best suited for the Data Analyst role\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Run the Streamlit app for an interactive UI: `streamlit run app/main.py`\n",
    "- Upload your own resumes and job descriptions\n",
    "- Configure different embedding providers (Ollama, Google) in `.env`"
